            <p>This is a place sharing experiences of space and time. 
            Each of the spaces are experienced with a new mindset - 
            simply because not every day is the same, human emotions 
            change over time and new knowledge is aquired continuously.
            <br>
            Spaces can be described in images and words, by nice quotes, 
            by being linked to different points of view, and maps.
            <br><br>
            When time and space and change converge, we find place. We 
            arrive in Place when we resolve things. Place is peace of 
            mind and understanding. Place is knowledge of self. Place 
            is resolution. <b>Abdullah Ibrahim</b>
            <br><br>
            I like to use the term alchemy, which is the soul of the world, 
            or those of Jung's collective unconscious. You connect with a 
            space where everything is. <b>Paulo Coelho</b>
            <br><br>
            Faith is not Desire. Faith is Will. Desires are things that need 
            to be satisfied, whereas Will is a force. Will changes the space 
            around us,... <b>Paulo Coelho</b>
            <br><br>
            Nothing puzzles me more than the time and space; and yet nothing 
            troubles me less. <b>Charles Lamb</b>
